# Chaintech Network - React User Management Assignment

This is a **frontend-only user management project** built using **React + Vite** and **pnpm** as the package manager.  
It allows users to **sign up, log in, view their profile, and edit their profile information**, all handled through the browser’s **localStorage**.

##  Features

-  **Signup Page** – Users can register with a unique email address.
-  **Login Page** – Authenticates users by matching stored credentials.
-  **Profile Page** – Displays user details (username, email, password).
-  **Edit Profile Page** – Allows users to update their information.
-  **Show/Hide Password** – Secure and user-friendly password toggle.
-  **LocalStorage-based persistence** – Data remains after page reload.
-  **Navigation with React Router DOM** – Smooth page transitions.

# How It Works
Signup:
User enters username, email, and password → data is stored in localStorage under "users" key.
Duplicate emails are not allowed.

Login:
Checks credentials against stored users.
If valid, redirects to /profile and passes user email using React Router state.

Profile:
Displays user info by fetching it from localStorage.
Provides a link to edit profile details.

Edit Profile:
Allows the user to update their data and saves changes back to localStorage.

 Notes
All data is stored locally in the browser (no backend).

Refreshing the page does not log out the user as data is persistent in localStorage.
